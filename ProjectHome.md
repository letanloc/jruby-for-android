JRuby for Android is an application that provides a JRuby scripting environment for Android, including an IRB shell, source code editor and script manager.

JRuby's ability to call Java classes and methods, and especially Android code, makes this the perfect application for quick interactive hacking with the Android API, or lightweight Ruby scripting.

Scripts can be created in the source code editor, saved to the phone's sdcard, and executed via the application's IRB shell, allowing for an interactive coding experience. Code snippets can be directly executed by IRB, while scripts can also be written on a computer, transferred to the phone's sdcard, and then loaded and executed from there.

  * JRuby for Android runs JRuby version 1.4 which corresponds to Ruby version 1.8.7.
  * The application has been compiled against Android 1.6.
  * All testing has been done on an emulator as I don't have access to a real device. I'd love to get some feedback from someone who can test this out on an actual phone.
